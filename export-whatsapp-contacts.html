        How to export whatsapp contacts?

        <pre>
          Hello guys! Will Gomes here!
          
          Exporting contacts from WhatsApp is a widely used process, as you often want to use contact numbers to do remarketing campaigns, or to add personalized audiences to Facebook ads, or even create personalized audiences on google ads or some other tool of ads.
          
          Another point that also leads many people to want to export WhatsApp contacts, is the need to enter these contacts in systems, or even enter these contacts in Google Contacts, or import into their phones.

          I made this script that exports the contacts both in CSV file, as in Excel file or Google Contacts own file, to help anyone who needs to export contacts from WhatsApp, whatever the final goal.
        </pre>          
      </p>

      <h2>
        Export whatsapp contacts to Excel, CSV, or file to import into Google Contacts
      </h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
          With this script you can export WhatsApp contacts to excel files, CSV files for import into other systems, use on Facebook Ads or Google Ads. You can also export WhatsApp contacts in the format used to import them into Google Contacts, making them appear on your phone.
        </pre>          
      </p>

      <h2>
        Export contacts from whatsapp groups
      </h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
          With this script you can export WhatsApp group contacts to files, contacts from groups you participate in, you don't need to be a group administrator to be able to export contacts. Perfect for those who participate in many groups on WhatsApp and need to export all contacts to systems, save all contacts at once, or for marketing tools like google ads or Facebook ads.

      <p>
        <pre>
          The script also works to export contacts from WhatsApp direct from conversations in which these contacts are not saved on the phone, it exports all contacts in a spreadsheet or CSV.
        </pre>

      <h2>
        Save all unsaved whatsapp contacts at once
      </h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
          This script can also be used to save all unsaved WhatsApp contacts at once, since you can export all contacts to a google contacts file and import them in the google contacts panel, making your contacts to be saved in a quick, simple and practical way. Having all WhatsApp contacts saved on your phone is great for those who have customers on their WhatsApp, because after saving the contacts all your customers will receive their status updates / WhatsApp stories, and this is very good for keeping in touch with the clients.
